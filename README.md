# Milow

## Short background

This was my absolute first hardware project. I challenged myself to build a small robot ( basically a small car) that could be controlled in real time via the internet. This was before I had read any courses in hardware on the university.

## Hardware

Arduino Uno R3 - for controlling the motors, and display.

ESP8266 - For Wifi connection

## Software

Angular on the frontend and Node and express on the backend. This is not a very sturdy web built though. But it lets you try a way of controlling the arduino from a webserver via websockets.

## It works!

It actually worked. Since this was more of a proof of consept project I never took the time to clean up the code or omptimize it but still, I had a lot of fun with this. I now call it Milow, enjoy.
